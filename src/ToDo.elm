--TODO: Show raid size on map, maybe by size of circle, maybe small raid plaque?

--TODO: Stretched lines still poor on low res displays. Maybe bring back "gradient"
--so we can make the beam brightnmess fall off less quickly when abs(slope) is high.
--Try deriving Y for X-epsilon and X+epsilon, where epsilon = half an increment of resolution;
--Y can be the average, and the difference we use to vertically anti-alias the beam.
