--DONE: Summary page showing actual incoming tracks with user plots overlaid.
--TODO: Checkbox to show actual tracks. Possibly protect that somehow during 'game turn'.
--TODO: Explanatory notes on MapPage.
--DONE: Now worried that all the craft are converging on the station -- is this real?
--DONE: Map needs rotating or flipping and what about LOS?
--TODO: Store all target locations when user enters Bearing & Range? This may make correlation possible.
--DONE: Show plots as some kind of symbol.
--DONE: Adjust map calibration for consistency with approx range.
--TODO: Derive some average closeness metric?
--TODO: Add some variation to direction of travel of each raid.
--TODO: Add "more ..." on explanatory popups to display overlaid window with more information. (??)
--TODO: Find nice way to constrain to 14 active aircraft (plus two ground rays). (Perhaps just cull the oldest.)
--TODO: Test on Android tablet !! (Currently using some webkit-only CSS tags to control touch actions.)
--TODO: Installable on iOS. -- Probably means getting to grips with Cordova/PhoneGap.
--TODO: Reset WebGL time occasionally as the noise visibly degrades, or fix otherwise.
--TODO: Fit it on 800x600 screen?
