This application aims to give an impression of being an operator
at a Chain Home station during the Battle of Britain in 1940.

**Mode selection** lets you discover how different types of raid
 would appear on the tube, and how the operator would find each raid's data
 to be passed on to Fighter Command. You can then test your skills with a series of incoming raids.

**Receiver** is a slightly simplified mock-up of the main operator's control panel.
This is what you use to detect raids and enter readings into the electrical calculator.

**Calculator** illustrates the output from the electrical calculator that derives
 the position and height, and collates information for Fighter Command.

**Map** allows you to see how well your plots correspond with the actual raid positions.
This of course would not have been available to the operator!

Each tab (other than this one) has a green **?** button which will
provide some explanation of the elements,

This has been tested satisfactorily on Safari, Chrome, Opera and Firefox browsers on MacOS X,
and Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge browsers on Windows 10.
It does **not** work with Internet Explorer 10 on Windows 10.
It also works on iPad with iOS 13.4 or higher;
the iPad Mini will work but the screen is too small to use effectively.
No other tablets have been tested; feedback would be welcome but there is NO SUPPORT.
