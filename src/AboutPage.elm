## What is this?

This application aims to give an impression of being an operator
at a Chain Home station during the Battle of Britain in 1940.

## How should I use this?

Using the Menu, under **Learn & Play**, discover how different types of raid
would appear on the tube, and how the operator would find the raids' bearing, height
and strength to be passed on to Fighter Command.

You can then test your skills with a series of incoming raids.

**Receiver** is a mock-up of the main operator's control panel, slightly simplified here.

**Calculator** illustrates the output from the electrical calculator that derives the height and
summarises the information to be passed to Fighter Command.

**Map** allows you to see how well your plots correspond with the actual raid positions.
This of course would not have been available to the operator!

Each screen (other than this one) has a green **?** button which will provide some explanation of the elements,
